Slalom/Microchip Internet of Things: Smartamation Project for Intelligent-Control of Sprinkler Systems

The intentent of this project is to demonstrate the abilities of the wifi-IOT chip collection from Microchip and to companion hardware enabled solutions with Slalom's crafted UI. 

This solution will be soft-focused around a web-application (mobile-friendly) for the user-interface. The interface will allow modifications to the presets of the application but the real heart of the solution is comprised around robust business logic, API tie-ins, and real-time sensor information being fed to the cloud.
